### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kayode Adeyemi

<div align="justify">
I'm a software engineer with professional experience working as a Nodejs/Python and AWS DevOps engineer. I've been able to work on various applications and I have a wide range of experience building enterprise applications. I find myself working on multiple tools, techniques, and processes ranging from Git for version control to code reviews and JIRA, Trello Board, Pivotal Tracker for agile development, AWS CDK, Eksctl, Amazon web services, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Docker, Nexus, Bash, CircleCI, and Travis CI for Automating Builds. Deep mastery of key AWS services such as EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, and EKS(ECS and/or Fargate). I care deeply about code quality for efficiency and maintainability, as well as creating readable documentation and clean architecture.
